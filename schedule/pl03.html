        <code>Abstract:</code><br/> This talk will present the
        Italian interuniversity center ISME, established in 1999.
        ISME is composed by 9 Universities and has its background
        mainly in Systems and Control Engineering, Applied
        Mechanics and Computer Science. The activities of the ISME
        researchers will be presented trough brief overviews of
        some current and recent projects funded by National calls,
        the Italian Defense and the European Union. Topics will
        cover, among the others, underwater intervention, multiple
        vehicles coordination for geophysical applications, asset
        surveillance.
