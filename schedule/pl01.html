        <code>Abstract:</code><br/> This talk will describe insights gained from
        over a decade of autonomous marine systems development at the University
        of Sydney’s Australian Centre for Field Robotics. Over the course of
        this time, we have developed and deployed numerous underwater vehicles
        and imaging platforms in support of applications in engineering science,
        marine ecology, archaeology and geoscience. We have operated an
        Australia-wide benthic observing program designed to deliver precisely
        navigated, repeat imagery of the seafloor. This initiative makes
        extensive use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to collect
        high-resolution stereo imagery, multibeam sonar and water column
        measurements on an annual or semi-annual basis at sites around
        Australia, spanning the full latitudinal range of the continent from
        tropical reefs in the north to temperate regions in the south. The
        program has been very successful over the past decade, collecting
        millions of images of the seafloor around Australia and making these
        available to the scientific community through online data portals. These
        observations are providing important insights into the dynamics of key
        ecological sites and their responses to changes in oceanographic
        conditions through time. We have also contributed to expeditions to
        document coral bleaching, cyclone recovery, submerged neolithic
        settlement sites, ancient shipwrecks, methane seeps and deepwater
        hydrothermal vents. The talk will also consider some of our more recent
        work focused on developing automated tools for working with this imagery
        and illustrate how this is being used to inform further exploration work
        using these platforms.

        the Digital Sciences Initiative at the University of Sydney and
        Professor of Marine Robotics at the Australian Centre for Field
        Robotics. He leads the Marine Systems group within the ACFR and is the
        head of Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System Autonomous
        Underwater Vehicle Facility. His research interests focus on aspects of
        navigation, mapping, planning and control as applied to autonomous
        marine systems and the interpretation of the data collected by these
        systems. He has always had a strong focus on fielding real systems in
        support of scientific applications.
