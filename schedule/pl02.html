        <code>Abstract:</code><br />
        The digitization of practically everything coupled with advances in
        machine learning, and advanced robotics promises a future with
        democratized use of machines and wide-spread use of AI and robots. While
        the last 60 years have defined the field of industrial robots and
        empowered hard bodied robots to execute complex assembly tasks in
        constrained industrial settings, the next 60 years could be ushering in
        our time with pervasive robots that come in a diversity of forms and
        materials, extending our reach into far-away worlds in novel ways. In
        this talk I will discuss recent developments in underwater robotics,
        focusing on (1) computational co-design of underwater robots and (2) new
        machine learning models that can run online on edge devices, enabling
        underwater learning-based perception and control underwater.

        Daniela Rus is the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of
        Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Director of the Computer
        Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. Prof.
        Rus's research interests are in robotics and artificial intelligence.
        The key focus of her research is to develop the science and engineering
        of autonomy. She is a MacArthur Fellow, a fellow of ACM, IEEE, AAAI and
        AAAS, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and of the
        American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is the recipient of the
        Engelberger Award for robotics, the IEEE RAS Pioneer award, IEEE RAS
        Technical award, Mass TLC Innovation Catalyst Award, and the IJCAI John
        McCarthy Award. She earned her PhD in Computer Science from Cornell
        University.
